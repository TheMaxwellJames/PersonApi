## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) (>= 7.3)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) (or another supported database)
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation) (>= 8.0)

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd PersonApi


Install project dependencies using Composer:

composer install



## Database Configuration
Create a new MySQL database for your project.

Copy the .env.example file to .env:
cp .env.example .env



Open the .env file and configure the database connection details:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password





Run database migrations to create the "people" table:

php artisan migrate



## Start the development server:

php artisan serve


Your API will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.

## API Endpoints
The following API endpoints are available:

# POST /api/persons: Create a new person.
# GET /api/persons/{id}: Retrieve details of a person by ID.
# PUT /api/persons/{id}: Update details of an existing person by ID.
# DELETE /api/persons/{id}: Delete a person by ID.


For detailed request and response examples, please refer to the API documentation.

## Authentication
This API does not require authentication for the sake of simplicity. In a production environment, it's recommended to implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API.

## Usage
You can use tools like Postman to interact with the API. Follow these steps:

# Import the Postman Collection for this API.
# Use the collection to send requests to the API endpoints.
